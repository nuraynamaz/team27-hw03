        <p class="card"> In this project, the main aim of our team was to construct various
            logic gates and to understand their fundamental operations and applications.
            All of us learned about general understanding of how <strong> NOT, AND, OR </strong> gates work, and their importance. </p>

        <div class="container">
            <h3>NOT gate</h3>
            <div class="card">
              <p>
                The NOT gate returned the inverted form of the input: for an input of 1, the output was 0 and vice versa. This circuit connected the base 
                of an NPN transistor to the input through a 2kΩ resistor. When the input was on 1, the transistor conducted - which turned the LED off - 
                that is output 0. Output was 1 while the input was 0, the transistor remained off, and the LED was ON; 
                we used a resistor to manage the current and protect the transistor, and it worked successfully as expected.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h3>  OR gate </h3>
            <div class="card">
             
              <p>
                If at least one of the inputs was 1, the OR gate would output 1. In our parallel circuit, each input was connected to the transistor's base 
                through a 2kΩ resistor. When either or both inputs were 1, the transistor conducted and hence passed current to light up the LED (output 1). If 
                both the inputs were 0, then the transistor remained off, so the LED was OFF (output 0).  At the end, the circuit performed accordingly with the
                 resistors which ensured that the transistor was not overloaded.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h3>AND gate </h3> 
            <div class="card">
             
              <p>
                The AND gate gave 1 output only in the case when both inputs were 1. In our construction, we connected NPN transistors in series controlled 
                by different inputs with a 2kΩ resistor. If both inputs were 1, then both the transistors conducted, and the LED lit up (that is, output 1). 
                In the case when at least one input was 0, accordingly, neither transistor conducted, blocking the current, and the LED stayed OFF (output 0).
                 The circuit worked properly, that is both inputs needed to be 1 to provide an ON condition for the LED.
             </p>
            </div>
            <h3>NAND gate</h3> 
            <div class="card">
             
              <p>
                The NAND gate returned 0 only if both the inputs were 1. It uses the same setup as the AND gate but provides the inverse of the result. In our 
                construction of NAND gate together with Team 30, when both the inputs were 1, both the transistors conducted, and the LED was off (output 0). 
                When each input was zero, the current ceased, and the LED turned on - output 1. The circuit worked as expected: the resistors saved current levels,
                 and the correct logic behavior was there.

        <h1> Difficulties</h1>
        <p class="card"> 
            OR gate was the most complicated gate for us, as it has more components to combine. Even, we tried it 3 or 4 times, at the end we achieved our goal, and 
            accomplished successfully. Also, in our first lab, we were a little bit confused when we constructed a NOT-gate. We had mistaken the cathode and anode sides of 
            LED. <strong>Latafat Aghazadeh </strong> from <em>Team 04 </em> explained we had to change the place of LED. Additionally, as shown from our video, when we were combining the AND-gate, an
            error occurred. We did not push the button, but the LED was on which was not appropriate for AND-gate. While we tried to find out our mistake, we realized that we 
            did not connect the emitter of the transistor to the cathode of power supply. After correction, everything was fixed, and the AND-gate worked correctly. At the end, 
            while we were combining NAND-gate together with Team 30, we had a mistake in connecting output of the AND-gate to the input of NOT-gate. Then, with the help of Lab 
            Coordinator <strong> Mr. Nariman Vahabli </strong> we resolved this issue.
